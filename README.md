# Secure and Efficient Key Derivation in Portfolio Authentication Schemes Using Blakley Secret Sharing

This repository holds the code to the paper "Secure and Efficient Key Derivation in Portfolio Authentication Schemes Using Blakley Secret Sharing" by Peter Mayer and Melanie Volkamer (doi). The code implements and illustrates the procedure of the verification scheme along the example of a graphical recognition-based authentication scheme. The first section of the Mathematica notebook contains all the parameters needed for the computation. The second section details the six steps neeed to create the public information (analog of e.g. the stored hash in traditional text password settings). The third section details the five steps required to verify the user input. The fourth section contains the functions used in the efficiency evalaution.
